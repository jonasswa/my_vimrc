# SETUP
My .vimrc file set up for working with python. This repo is made for me so I can copy it whenever I go to another server or computer or whatever, but feel free to copy it. It's pretty basic.
Add the .vimrc file to your home dir. After that, follow the steps below.

```bash
sudo apt-get remove vim-tiny
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vim-gtk
```
